    //All values in code are a data type.
    //There are 4 main types for use

    int integer = 0; //int signifies a whole number which can not have a decimal. when doing math it ALWAYS rounds down

    double doubleNumber = 0.0001; //double is a number with decimals, there is a slight loss of accuracy but it is minor

    boolean bool = false; //boolean is a true false value.

    String stings = "words"; //strings signify words
